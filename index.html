            I am a student at Stanford University. I particularly enjoy computer systems and challenging myself with different topics in math (specifically analysis, algebra, and topology/geometry). Lately, I have been diving into AI/ML theory, agentic frameworks, and "neuro AI". Outside of technical work, I am a trained ballroom/latin dancer, and I enjoy surfing and drinking coffee (and working at coffee shops).

           Currently, I am a machine learning intern at <a href="https://www.science.xyz">Science</a> on their biology team working on critical automations. Alongside my primary work, I am getting a chance to learn from the incredibly intelligent folks and about topics such as ML theory and neuroscience. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.snowflake.com">Snowflake</a> on their ML team building models and infra to improve our <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/overview">Cortex ML</a> product -- Snowflake's auto-ML solution.
