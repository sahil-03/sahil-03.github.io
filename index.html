            I am a student at Stanford University studying computer systems and math. Lately, I have been diving into AI/ML theory and agents. Specifically, I am interested in questions of how we can improve model reasoning, context, and efficiency, and how we can apply these models as orchestrators to automate tasks more effectively. I also enjoy ballroom/latin dancing and surfing.

           Currently, I am a machine learning intern at <a href="https://www.science.xyz">Science</a> building computer vision models and pipelines for biology. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.snowflake.com">Snowflake</a> building ML infra and features to improve our <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/overview">Cortex ML</a> product -- Snowflake's auto-ML solution. Prior to that, I was a resesarch assistant work on the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/artificial-retina.html">Stanford Artificial Retina Project</a> (with EJ Chichilnisky and Pumiao Yan) building research tooling and investigating full bandwidth EI reconstruction from lossy compressed spikes using deep learning methods. Before that, I also interned at a data enterprise company building a Python connector (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/kypy/">KyPy</a>) to their OLAP data product.
