            I am a student at Stanford University. I particularly enjoy computer systems and challenging myself with different topics in math (I enjoy analysis, combinatorics, and topology/geometry). I aim to apply what I am learning to problems in neuroscience, specifically regarding brain-computer interfaces, and artificial intelligence, which I enjoy self-learning. I believe these are the primary areas where we can really begin to re-engineer the human experience.

           Currently, I am working at Snowflake on their ML team. I am building models and infra to improve our <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/overview">Cortex ML</a> product -- Snowflake's auto-ML solution. At Stanford, I am researching deep learning based methods to reconstruct full bandwidth EIs (electrical images) of k-bit quantized retinal spikes. The aim of this research is to better aid in wired-OR configuration for the visually impaired.
